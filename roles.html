    <br>
  
    <h2><b> Rebecca Watson - Website Developer and Content Creation Contributor</b></h2>
    <p>Rebecca has thoroughly enjoyed taking on the majority of html and css coding, for the Assignment 3 team website on Github. Rebecca likes writing and in responding to the assessment brief, has contributed to multiple sections within the document with research, writing and proofreading. Creating original content, relevant for detailing the project concept, and aimed at engaging readers in the team's app idea aka 'Yogi' has been Rebecca's focus in Assignment 3. </p>
  
    <h2><b> Martin Lee - Ideas Architect</b></h2>
    <p>Martin was the original concept creator of the idea behind Yogi. Through the formation of Team_Name_404, Martin was designated the ideas architect as he was able to formulate and implement key aspects of the mobile application that we now know as Yogi. We discovered the importance of this role due to the nature of various ideas and features that we initially intended Yogi to have. By having an ideas architect who not only formulated and compared ideas given by the team, we were able to use his abilities to prioritise designs and features that would be given the go ahead for Yogi. </p>
