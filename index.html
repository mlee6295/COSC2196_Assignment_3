    <p><b>Name:</b> Rebecca Watson</p>
    <p><b>Student Number:</b> s3903758</p>
<p>Rebecca is a multicultural Australian and proud Wiradjuri person. Born and raised in South East Qld, Rebecca’s interest in IT really kicked off in early 2000 when introduced by a friend to a game called Petz, and consequently spent many hours surfing ‘the web’ engaging with an active online community, as well as downloading and integrating all kinds of extra files and patches to enhance the game experience. Rebecca hopes that studying at RMIT will help her understand many aspects of the IT including programming, website design and code, the cloud, and online security – and how this might lead to a more focused future career path in marketing, or business analysis. Rebecca is a passionate and lifelong horse lover, with a small team of six performance horses that she has bred and trains for dressage competitions.</p> 
    <p>Rebecca is also the proud owner of Kes, a rescue dog who has been a member of the family for 7 years.</p>

    <h2> Group Processes</h2>
    <p>The members of Team_Name_404 for Assignment 3, worked very well together in Assignment 2. We took time in our first group meeting for Assignment 3 to reflect on what worked for the previous assessment, and what we would change going forward. We decided to continue with the following processes: </p>
    <ul>
<li>No set ‘team leader’, instead each member responsible for sharing the workload. 
<li>Streamline channels on MS Teams, using a General channel for chat and relevant channels only for uploading relevant files. 
<li>Use MS Teams as main point of contact for all assignment related correspondence. 
<li>Schedule meetings either once or twice a week to be conducted through MS Teams. 
  <li>Each team member to commit their own work to Github. 
    <li>Each team member to supply references for assignment report bibliography. 
    </ul>
<p>Further details on Group Processes for Team_Name_404 are outlined in ‘Group Processes and Communications’ under ‘Project Description’. </p>

    <h2>Career Plans</h2>
    
    <p>Each member of Team_Name_404 has decided to stay on the same career plan following completion of Assignment 2. Ideal jobs as listed in the table were all in high demand according to the Burning Glass data analysed for Assignment 2. Ideal careers chosen by each member of Team_Name_404 show the same emphasis on General Soft Skills; and interestingly, each of our ideal jobs is in a leadership role. The ability to not only show leadership, yet also be a good team player is important in each role listed for the environment the candidate will be working in.</p>
<p>Similarly, knowledge of a range of IT hard skills is also necessary for each of the roles as shown in the table displayed. Some may not all be necessary for each role eg security, software engineering and web design, whereas others like knowledge of the cloud and databases are definitely required for effective future developments of companies in a dynamic and changing IT world.</p>
<p>Each of the team members has chosen a varying yet exciting and ambitious future career goal within the world of Information Technology and look forward to continuing through their studies with RMIT to gain the skills needed to achieve them.</p>
