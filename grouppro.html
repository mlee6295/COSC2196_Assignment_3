    <h1>Group Processes and Communications</h1>
    <p>Communications between group members of Team_Name_404 were successful with the use of MS Teams in Assignment 2. We are continuing to utilize MS Teams as our primary communication channel for Assignment 3 and 5. We will create channels for general discussion, a channel for each assignment, and one channel for Meetings (schedules, agendas and minutes). Uploading of documents and graphics by group members for review and discussion will first be done in the appropriate MS Teams channel, then committed to the GitHub repository folders for storage and further collaboration/integration in creating our website. </p>
<p>Our meetings will be scheduled for once a week and take place on MS Teams, following the process set out by a pre-prepared agenda. Each member will be visible on camera and meetings will be recorded. One team member will chair each meeting, while one other will take the minutes/record the actions – this will be rotated between group members, and aim to share the meeting responsibilities. Group members will give updates on their tasks at each meeting, and the agenda will invite further discussion for decisions on assignment content and creation. Once the meeting is complete, minutes will be uploaded to the Meetings channel, and used to form the upcoming meeting agenda.</p>
<p>In the event of a group member not responding to communications – depending on the urgency in which a response is needed – a timeframe of 48 hours to respond via email or MS Teams will be given. If there is no response, the rest of the group may decide to contact their tutor or class coordinator via email for further direction. One student will be elected to do so, on behalf of their group members and a formal email will be sent through their RMIT student email account to the listed staff email account of the tutor/student coordinator. Active group members will continue working on their tasks and assignment content in the meantime until further direction is given. </p>
