      <h1><center>Scope and Limits</center></h1>
    <p>If someone were to ask us at Team_Name_404 what Yogi was about and what we can show them in terms of the results of our work so far. We would confidently be able to show them the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>UI/UX design of the application.
    <li>The premise of real-time information through location data where users can check-in to various parks and services in their area.
    <li>Profile creation for individual dogs that includes other users tags of the dog and basic information provided by the owner.
    <li>The feature for tagging dogs with pre-set characteristics, like what you would see from services such as Uber/UberEats during the rating of the driver/delivery person.
    <li>Basic operation of the application.
    <li>Photo/Video upload of your dog.
    </ul>
    <p>Yogi is intention is not to be some flashy app that can do it all like we see of Facebook, Instagram, etc. The creation and idea of this app is for it to be a bridge the connects a local community together, allowing users to get in touch with other dog owners and breeds that they did not know were in the area.</p>
    <p>To create and deliver a fully functionable app that embraces all our ideas and discussed features is unforeseeable. This is due to various reason such as time, skills, motivation, funding, etc. As much as we would love our app to be diverse and offer numerous amounts of services, we understood the impact it would have had on the quality of work of the app. Therefore, we have already discussed on a way to scale our application back to something that is basic, embodies our ideas and deliverable within a given timeframe.</p>
    <p>The original concept and feature of Yogi allowing dog owners to browse and book a local dog walker, or someone who offers dog walking services was phased out. Reason being is that the delivery of this idea would have been limited due to the timeframe we are given and the current presentable skillsets we all have. To implement a fully functional booking system as well as a payment system with no flaw in security is currently beyond our scope of abilities.</p>
    <p>For proper fully functionable real-time data along with updates of check-ins at parks and services within your local area will not be initially implemented. We intend this to be implemented for a certain area at first, then slowly expand to others (for example it will be implemented and launched in one state first, then over time in another state). Instantly launching this to be a fully workable app within Australia without a smaller scale test will have many initial bugs and flaws. By limiting ourselves to a smaller area at first, we will be able to test for quality assurance of the initial launch/work. This will allow us to grasp what is currently achievable and what can be done better in future launches to other areas.<p>
