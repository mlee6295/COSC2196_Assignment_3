    <h1>Risks</h1>
     <h1>The dog running away</h1>
     <p>The dog may break free from the leash and run away. This is a very serious risk because the client will be very unhappy and will potentially sue. Not only that, it will ruin our business reputation and prevent us from doing more business.</p>
     <h1>The dog injuring the dog walker</h1> 
     <p>If the dog walker mishandles the animal or if it is a particularly aggressive breed, the dog may bite him. To prevent this we will have to include the cost of medical bills as a risk</p> 
     <h1>In hot weather, for dogs, too much sun can be harmful.</h1> 
     <p>In some places, it is odd to see a dog being walked when it is not winter. The concrete is too hot to walk the dog. Just like humans, dogs can get sunburned and their feet can get burned on hot pavement. Heatstroke is another major concern in the summer months, and while dogs love to be outside, theyâ€™re wearing fur and are much more susceptible to getting overheated.</p>
     <h1>Security threats</h1>
     <p>Launching an application that allows users to share personal information, payment details, and sensitive data is vulnerable to potential hacks and security breaches. Maintaining a safe and secure application at all times is essential to prevent our app from being removed from the online marketplace.</p>
     <h1>There are already big players on the market that create extreme competition</h1>
     <p>All businesses are affected in some way by their competitors, and this may have an impact on the decisions we make. For example, if we offer a discount for a limited time, other businesses may offer a discount for a longer time. Similarly, if we add new features our competitors may also wish to do the same.</p>
