    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>The idea behind Yogi when it was first conceptualised, was an app that offered dog owners the ability to easily find and book a dog walking service. It would be an app that allowed individuals who offer these services or have spare time in their day to walk these dogs when the owner is unable to themselves.</p>
    <p>Through the formation of Team_Name_404, we brainstormed ideas of what would set Yogi apart, and what type of platform we wanted it to be. We are now focused on developing a community for dog owners to further explore places and services within their area by enhancing their experiences with real-time feedback from other Yogi users.</p>
    <p>Our end goal at Team_Name_404 is to build Yogi into a fun and safe social media platform that is purely for dogs. We do not want the app to go down the path of other current day social media platforms, where these profiles are just their owners who seek to exploit and use their dog for their own financial gain and benefits.</p> 
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>What makes the creation of Yogi intriguing to us is the idea behind the app. In this current century, 53.6% of the world's population uses social media. The average daily usage is 2 hours and 25 minutes (Chaffey, 2021). This makes social media almost unavoidable if you convert that % to a number (approximately 4.22 billion people). That is a lot of people who use social media around the globe. This makes the desire to own a pet undoubtedly high due to the influence of social media apps such as Instagram, tiktok, etc, that allow users to capture photos and videos of their pets and upload them with convenience.</p>
    <p>By creating a social media platform for dogs and only dogs, who wouldn’t want that? We believe Yogi will be a bridge that connects dogs local to each other and in turn creating a community that allows others to gain real-time information of potential playmates in the area.</p>
    <p>Working on this project may show future employers our capabilities in developing current innovative ideas as a team, attractive to a broad audience with the ability to create successful returns in earnings.</p>
    <h1>Landscape</h1>
    <p>Through a bit of research on google and seeing what is currently available on both the apple and android app store. There is only one current competitor that has similar ideas as ours within Australia.</p>
    <p>This sole competitor being Petsforever. Petsforever advertises themselves as a social media platform for dogs that allow you to do similar things such as Facebook or Instagram. Where you upload posts, videos, and photos of your dog/pets. The posts are then able to be forwarded and re-posted onto your other social media platforms.</p>
    <p>What makes Yogi stand out compared to Petsforever is that Petsforever is a shop front, where they are pretending to be a social media platform just to be able to sell products through their own online shop. As well as trying to be a resource for pets where they provide “professional” information on animals.</p>
    <p>Yogi is purely a social media platform for dogs, where it will be a medium for pet/dog related services, rather than a shop front trying to sell those services up front. Yogi is intended to be a platform to create a community for dogs, where real time information allows users to be able to create/join in and keep up to date on this community. Yogi also does not have the ability to repost/rehash onto other social media like Petsforever. This function just makes the app itself seem redundant, as they may as well just create a social media platform for their dogs on those social media rather than have one social media platform post onto another.</p>
