    <h1>Project Aims</h1>
     <p>The main goal is planning on the monetization strategy for our business. There are a few ways that we can use to earn revenue from the dog walking app.</p>
       <h1>1. Paid ads for dog-related products:</h1>
       <p>We can easily monetize our application by showing relevant ads to users. Many pet-related businesses will pay us for running their ads on the app. All we have to do is come up with a way of implementing advertisements into our app without irritating users, and make sure that the company we are coming in a partnership with is reliable and does not promote any harmful products for animals.</p>
       <h1>2. Analyze Competitors:</h1>
       <p>We need to find out who our competitors are. What’s the best dog walking app? What kind of services do they provide? What sort of marketing channels they use and how are they performing in the market. Next, we should see the type of features they have in their apps. This doesn’t mean we will copy them, this is only for understanding and getting inspired. We have to think about what we can do better than them and make sure we develop the best dog walking app for walkers as well as dog owners.</p>
       <h1>3. Find Partners:</h1>
       <p>A business that is mutually beneficial for two parties is more likely to be successful. Apart from comparing our competitors, we should also find out businesses that are related to ours but are not competitors to collaborate with them. For instance vet hospitals, pet-food brands or stores, pet grooming, or training institutes. We can partner with such firms and bring in more business.</p>
       <h1>4. Surcharges:</h1>
       <p>This is similar to Uber surge prices. Many times dog owners cannot find dog walkers in their area due to huge demand. We can provide a dog walker to such dog owners at a higher rate. This helps us as well as dog walkers to earn more.</p>
       <h1>5. One time Registration Fees:</h1>
       <p>This one is for service providers and pet’s parents. Having to pay one registration fee would not only help us increase revenue, but also help them take advantage of the various features of our platform.</p>
       <h1>6. Features are the keys to success:</h1>
       <p>Our app can attract a wider audience only if it has cutting-edge features integrated into it. Features make apps unique when compared to others in the market. Besides, stand-apart features are highly essential to enhance user experience. We should also make sure we use the latest technologies to increase the chances of our app’s success.</p>
       <h1>7. Gather user feedback:</h1>
       <p>Gathering feedback from app users has several advantages. 

Firstly, we can find out: 

Whether your app meets user expectations or not 

How well the user experience is shaped, and so on.  

Besides, app users can point out app disadvantages that we would never notice. Secondly, we ask them what features they want us to add to the app to make it more convenient. By implementing those features, we will give app users the sense of being heard, and also encourage them to participate more and send more feedback in the future.</p>
