    <h2>Column 2</h2>
    <p>Some text.. The cloud is set to provide the foundations for future IT developments, accessible to a wide array of global users. It aims to enhance user experiences, opportunities and create further employment opportunities. We live in an exciting new technological world, and the cloud has personally affected me and those close to me in positive ways. I can access and complete a university degree via Canvas with RMIT, enhancing future career opportunities. I can connect and collaborate with students for team projects on SaaS cloud services - and then future business - via Microsoft Teams and GitHub. I can safely ask artificial intelligence â€“ Hey Google - for assistance and directions, hands free while driving my car. I can access and enjoy libraries of entertainment in the form of Netflix streaming. Our family business has a website with user accounts and online products for purchase to be hosted and accessed via the cloud, boosting sales and customer relations. Cost effect availability of serverless computing or PaaS offers me the opportunity to develop games or applications. </p>
