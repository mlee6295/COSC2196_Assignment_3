      <h1><center>Tools and Technologies</center></h1>
      <h2><b>Used for website and team collaboration, specifically to build A3 artefacts:</b></h2>
      <p>Github</p>
      <p>MS Teams</p>
      
      <p>Figma for wireframe/graphic design work/ UI design/ prototyping designs.</p> 

      <p>Google Maps</p>
      


      <h2><b>Those needed for further development and delivering a final app product, ready for market in an app store: </b></h2>

<p><b>AWS (Amazon Web Services) for secure cloud platform. Could actually host the entire server infrastructure. Services that might work for us:</b></p>
      <ul>
<li>AWS Cloud tools - see below
<li>AWS Amplify - development platform for secure and scalable mobile apps. It includes ready-to-use UI components like sign up and login forms for the app. 
<li>AWS Amplify Framework to develop UI components 
<li>AWS Amplify API
<li>AWS Amplify Authentication library which provisions Amazon Cognito.  
<li>AWS/Amazon Cognito (for user accounts) and manage it from AWS Amplify.
    <li>Amazon CodePipeline and CodeDeploy for Continuous Integration
<li>React Native can give cross-platform for iOS and Android and allows push notifications to both. 
<li>Amazon Pinpoint for push notifications. 
<li>AWS Amplify DataStore libraries, AWS AppSync (creates flexible and secure APIs which integrate into other AWS services), and Amazon DynamoDB (data storage), for data management
    <li>Amazon Athena for basic analytics, moving to Amazon Kinesis when a certain amount of users is reached
<li>AWS Device Farm for testing
      </ul>
      <p>API/s</p>

    

<p> **Also look at beta distribution tools setup on the platform - Fabric, App Center recommended. They give live crash reports, feedback from users and distribute to the betas (they assist in quality of product) â€“ Ubertesters would be a good fit.</p> 

      <p>Choose code architecture for the project - eg MVVP, VIPER, MVC, Clean Swift.</p>



A tool like Zeplin https://zeplin.io/ for UI designers and developers. Enables teams to efficiently collaboration on design system. 

<p>Register app to third party suppliers if using their services - eg Google Play Console, Google Maps (push notifications)</p>

<p>Smartphone Test Farm (STF) https://openstf.io/ - allows developers to manage and control real time testing on remote devices, and running automated tests on many devices at once using software like Bitrise</p>

      <p>https://auth0.com/ - Auth0 to implement authentication features</p>
