    <p>Work on Assignment 3 started in Week 9 for Team_Name_404, as we handed in our Assignment 2 at the end of Week 8. The team allowed ourselves the two days of the weekend before the start of Week 9 to refresh and recharge. </p> 
<p><b>Team_Name_404 recognises the high level of skill involved in bringing a viable app to the market and have used this timeline to show what they would do in real-time with their current skills. We believe in this project idea and do plan to keep working on it past completion of the Introduction to IT unit. This timeframe reflects what we realistically plan to do with the 10 weeks after this unit is finished. </b>
