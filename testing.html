    <p>Making sure our app is tested at the prototype stage, and out in the real world before launch will be crucial to our project success. Research conducted by Ubertesters found that 30% of apps placed in an app store arrive with critical bugs, which could have been prevented by beta testing (Rachlin, 2016). Receiving feedback on our design, and discovering limitations or bugs that might not be found unless the app is being used in real time, will help to ensure our product triumphs instead of flops. With Yogi being intended as a casual use app, we estimate 25-40 testers will be a suitable target for our early prototype testing. Later, when the project is nearing launch, a beta testing group of 100-300 testers would be sought to test Yogi on their actual devices. The goal would be to have each feature of the ‘completed’ app (likely Week 21/22) tested by different beta users at least three or four times. </p> <img src="graphics/testingpic.jpg" style="padding: 15px;float:right;width:452px;height:301px;"> </img>
    
<p>For the initial group of 25-40 testers, the focus will be in conducting a marketing beta test, seeking feedback on how users interact with our interface and designs. As this app is being developed for the everyday user in mind, no prior skills are necessary other than basic knowledge of how a phone works. We will be able to find these testers in our existing friends and family groups. In the later stages, we will seek our beta-testers through an online advertisement on social media or relevant pet or dog forums. Another channel in attracting beta-testers may be through a crowd funding platform like Kickstarter, to drive awareness for Yogi as well as seeking more funding. Strangers in our target market interested in testing the nearly completed product, will hopefully provide useful and critical feedback before launch. A mobile application management platform will be used to manage the beta testing for our app (Kelly, 2016). Ubertesters delivers a platform for app beta testing and provides a wide range of feedback services like screenshot editing, crash logging and test case support (Software Testing Help, 2021). It looks to be a suitable platform in which our beta-testers can try Yogi and provide us with valuable feedback before launch. </p>
      <p> In our extended ten week timeframe, our Yogi app will undergo testing as outlined in Figure 1 (Rachlin, 2016).</p><br clear=left>
