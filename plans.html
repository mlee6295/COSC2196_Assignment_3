<p>Our team had our first group meeting for A3/5 on 29/4/21. The goals for the meeting and the week:</p>
<p>- debrief on A2 and decide on group processes for A3/5</p>
<p>- start breaking down each component of A3/5 between group members.</p>
<p>- Further develop the details of the project idea &ndash; &lsquo;Yogi&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each of us was a little fatigued from the efforts of submitting A2 only a few days before; the meeting gave a few starting points to group members &ndash; completing their individual team profile, reading more comprehensively through the assignment specifications, and two group members took on tasks as detailed in their entries below.</p>

<p>While awaiting feedback from A2 on our project idea, we decided that we needed more design ideas for the layout and &lsquo;look&rsquo; of our app. This included colours, fonts, possible logo/graphic ideas.</p>
<p>The project was still very much focused primarily on connecting services of dog walkers and pet sitters with dogs and owners in their respective areas. There was an idea that revenue would be created through advertising by relevant industry services in the app. The Tinder-inspired swipe left or right for matching dog walkers with the dog profiles was a desired function for the app.</p>
<p>At this stage, the thought of us building an app was daunting for the group with our current skill level. We realized that we needed to understand and do further research on the technical aspects of building an app (see below in Content) before the next meeting.</p>
