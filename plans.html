<p>- Further develop the details of the project idea &ndash; &lsquo;Yogi&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each of us was a little fatigued from the efforts of submitting A2 only a few days before; the meeting gave a few starting points to group members &ndash; completing their individual team profile, reading more comprehensively through the assignment specifications, and two group members took on tasks as detailed in their entries below.</p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>
</td>

<p>While awaiting feedback from A2 on our project idea, we decided that we needed more design ideas for the layout and &lsquo;look&rsquo; of our app. This included colours, fonts, possible logo/graphic ideas.</p>
<p>The project was still very much focused primarily on connecting services of dog walkers and pet sitters with dogs and owners in their respective areas. There was an idea that revenue would be created through advertising by relevant industry services in the app. The Tinder-inspired swipe left or right for matching dog walkers with the dog profiles was a desired function for the app.</p>
<p>At this stage, the thought of us building an app was daunting for the group with our current skill level. We realized that we needed to understand and do further research on the technical aspects of building an app (see below in Content) before the next meeting.</p>

<p>The group decided to make a new website for A3. As this assessment was asking for team members to ‘fork’ from the A2 Github repository, we each decided to investigate how this would be done. We would look on the Assignment 3 forum on Canvas to see if there were any students asking the same questions about forking Github that we had. 
<p>As a team we would think about the layout and look of our new website for A3 and bring ideas to the next meeting for further implementation or development.</p>

<p>Following the first meeting, Agenda and Minutes documents were taken for the meeting and uploaded to MS Teams. Each member had the first tasks of reading through A3 in more detail. We started by each drafting our personal information for the team profile and uploading this part to MS Teams for easy access to the files. </p>
<p>Rebecca researched generic steps and timelines for building an app from concept idea to being a product ready for market, which she storyboarded with Scrivener to help organize the project into parts and then compiled into a Word Doc to present to the group in our next team meeting. During this research, helpful graphs and table templates in which we could visually lay out parts of our A3 were saved and uploaded to MS Teams. </p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p>The Yogi app design was able to be further developed this week, after research following the previous week’s meeting and the question – how do we build an app from scratch? What are the stages? Anthony Clapp had also showed past students’ work in his weekly chat with a link to Figma. </p>
<p>Rebecca was able to supply a fairly comprehensive picture of Design, Pre-design and Development for mobile apps with a research document for the team to read through. It was decided that if the team could get to the prototype stage during the A3 timeline, it would be a significant artefact for us to deliver for our group project. </p>
<p>Wireframing and building a prototype for Yogi in the Figma online software was the next step forward. Paul was particularly interested in exploring this step further and created an account to start learning how to use the Figma software. His task was to prepare a design for the team to discuss at the next meeting and figure out how the wireframes would then make up our prototype for Yogi and demonstrate our tangible results towards the project implementation.</p> 
<p>We still had to decide on design ideas such as colours, logo and fonts at this stage.</p>

<p>It was decided that Martin would start a new group repository for team members in A3 and invited each member via email so we could get started committing any files or ideas. We still were not sure at this stage if we wanted to build something new from scratch, how it would look, colours, or if we would borrow a template and change the design to suit our needs. As a team, we decided a the meeting to look at template website designs and send the options to the group on MS Teams for discussion and decision. </p>
<p>Rebecca spent several hours in attempting to code a new website from scratch in html. It was good practice and learning how to html code to visually see what sort of layout was and was not going to suit, visually and functionally – the first framework wasn’t sophisticated enough (as shown in this photo) and the colours and layout idea was scrapped. It felt like a waste of time at this stage on how to build a new website. The team was then still contemplating a ready-made template and submitting any ideas for design and colours to the MS Teams General chat. (IMAGE 1 – FIRST TRY WEBSITE)</p>

<p>The research document prepared by Rebecca for team members was very useful in breaking down the remaining components between the group members. We were able to start working with more purpose on the Overview (Topic, Motivation, Landscape), Aims (goals and features crucial to the app) and start developing a more detailed Timeframe for the project. We also started to make lists and upload to a document on MS Teams which tools would be needed initially and for the continued 10 week timeframe for building the app. </p>
<p>Any drafts and finished sections of the project/A3 document were uploaded to MS Teams for review and discussion. </p>

<p>With the absence of Paul from the week’s meeting due to extenuating life circumstances, we still didn’t have a clear idea of how the app would look in design or function. He had been showing us examples of screenshots via MS Teams chat of the wireframes he had started so far, and the team was really excited to start seeing the project idea taking visual shape.</p> 
<p>Paul also finished the logo for Yogi, which he shared for feedback on MS Teams and with a couple of layout touches the logo was agreed upon and the current logo as of the finished assignment document. The inspiration came from a photo of Martin’s dog, the real Yogi, who is the inspiration for the project idea so it seemed right that he would be the face of app (see pictures inserted). Paul used a simple design program listed in ‘Tools’. (IMAGE 2 AND 3 – YOGI AND YOGI LOGO)</p>

<p><strong>Website</strong></p>
</td>

<p>The website design and colours were still up in the air; the team had been submitting their template ideas and colours to MS Teams, but no conclusion yet. The problem was, that grabbing a web template from somewhere else did not provide a CSS sheet – it instead linked to one somewhere else that could not be changed. The team decided that it would not be a good idea to use a template after all, with the lack of CSS to work with to develop our own unique website. Rebecca decided to have another try at building a design from scratch, even if it would not have any Javascript or extra fancy designs due to her skill at this point with html/css. A suitable bare-bones html grid template was found on W3schools.com and provided the start. Any colours were used at this point to build a working layout that looked smart and clean. Code was initially built on personal laptop files and tested in the browser and then moved to Github were all coding then continued.</p> 
<p>Github was starting to have more commits as the group began uploading files with content and folders to organize team work, with design elements and colours used for the logo as well as relevant graphics to be used in the website. (IMAGE 4 – NEW WEB TEMPLATE PURPLE)</p>

<p>Initial content work was beginning to be completed and uploaded to MS Teams. </p>
<p>Timeframe had the beginnings of an outline but was proving tricky in deciding on best layout and how to plan the 10+ weeks after our actual real-time spent on the project. We still had to decide on our roles in the group for A3 as they were sometimes interchangeable, depending on the work that was needing to be done to form the project idea and document. </p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>
</td>

<p>During the weekly meeting, Paul was able to show considerable progress on Yogi wireframes to team members. Seeing the functionality of the app and the visuals helped to really drill down the concept around how the app would be original, entertaining and essential to users. (IMAGE 5 – WIREFRAMES)</p>
<p>We decided the app would move away from the core idea of facilitating the service of connecting dog walkers to dogs and owners.</p> 
<p>We decided that the main theme of the app is foremost a fun interactive social media platform for dogs – instead of their owners (as per Instagram etc). Users would construct profiles for their dogs, using tags and locations, and being able to connect with other profiles as ‘friends’ in-app. We decided to stick with tags for fun identifiers instead of rating pets to foster a friendly community mood on the app between users.</p> 
<p>We decided there would be no messaging between users for privacy and protection.</p>
<p>We decided to drill down into the core concept of developing a community for dogs and their owners with the use of geo-locations via Google maps for finding local parks, and services would be targeted for which area users were currently it.</p> 
<p>We decided that the local area services would function like pages on Facebook, paying fees for advertising and could be rated by users like in Google reviews.</p> 
<p><i>The core project idea moved away from connecting a service between users to being more about building a community within the app between users, instead of a focus on selling a service we wanted to provide a fun platform in which users can seek services but that is not the main purpose. The focus is on the dogs and their profiles and how this might translate to community meet ups and park visits in the real world.</i></p>

<p><strong>Website</strong></p>

<p>With the visualization of the wireframes, the website really started to take shape with colours and design (see progress photos below). The colours were matched to the Yogi logo. Dropdown boxes seemed the best way to add all the many sections to the navigation bar, as needed in the Project Overview section. Rebecca took time to learn the code via W3schools on how to do this – there was many frustrating moments, but it was still fun and very satisfying when the ideas on how the website would function started to all work!</p> 
<p>The framework of the website was complete and team members were able to start uploading their work into the relevant pages in the Github repository.</p>

<p>With this clearer idea on our Yogi concept, we were able to effectively answer any feedback from the marker on our A2 project idea. As a group, we decided on the details to clearly show our goals for initial revenue stream and investment, payments, security and privacy for our users in the app. We were able to decide which sections the additional app-building information would fit into our document/website report. We split up the task of Skills and Jobs between us – four group members, four position descriptions. We needed to still decide on exactly which positions we wanted to take out project to the next level.</p> 
<p>We decided Yogi would have his own place in the Team Profile section, to honour him as the inspiration for our project idea. </p> 
<p>Finished documents were uploaded to MS Teams and Github for assignment sections that were completed by team members. </p>

<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

<p>Team members tested the prototype of Yogi in Figma via their invite links sent by Paul. There was discussion around the use of the word ‘My’ eg ‘My Community’, ‘My Parks’ etc as opposed to just using the words ‘Community’ and ‘Parks’ as the headings for different app functions. We decided to leave the word ‘My’ in the headings as it added a more personal feeling to the places on our app that users would build their personal profile and preferences in. </p>
<p>We talked about the font and how to visually place the headings for pages.</p> 
<p>The last thing for Paul to do was find out how to embed the link from Figma into our website for any beta/A3 marker testing, as one of our main artefacts towards producing steps for making Yogi real and functional. </p>
