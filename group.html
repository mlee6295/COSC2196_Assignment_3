      <h2>Rebecca Watson</h2>
      <p>I have really enjoyed working with the members of Team_Name_404. We learnt a lot from our first assignment and were able to further develop a good group rapport, working together for the next two assignments. Each member was motivated to contribute, and the work was able to be distributed fairly within the group. There was a great level of respect in the group for each personâ€™s ideas and during discussion. </p>
<p>Personally, I prefer to not be doing too much assignment work on the due date. I prefer to be done a couple of days before, to reduce stress and have time to review the whole body of work, without the feeling of running out of time. This is probably the one thing I think could be improved. I understand that others have life commitments and are doing their best to also complete the work required, and may not be so anxious about deadlines as I am. </p>
<p>I was really surprised to see how the original project idea changed from assignment 2, during the assignment 3/5 process. I am personally really invested in being further involved in bringing the project to life as described in this assignment, past the mandatory work needed to deliver the assignments. I really believe in the project and actually working towards completing it - this is the thing that surprised me the most. I am excited to keep working with the team to build and deliver Yogi in the future. </p> 
<p>I learnt that as a Turbulent Architect (according to Myers-Briggs) it is in my nature to worry and stress over every little detail. I often take on too much work as a result, and I learned it is ok to let others take care of the work equally and trust they want to achieve as much as I do. I was not sure how working with people I have never met in real life would go, yet I have really enjoyed my time with the group members in assignment 3/5. It was great getting to know each member of Team_Name_404 on a more personal level, as fellow students also beginning their study journey with me.

      <h2>Martin Lee</h2>
      <p>Team_Name_404 was overall a pleasure to work with. As corny as it is to say, I could not have asked for better groups members for the duration of this course. Rebecca, Paul and Nour have offered me great insight on what it would be like to collaborate on a start-up project. All 3 of them were professional, punctual, and communicated effectively through teams.</p>
      <p>As we progressed through assignment 2, we unfortunately lost a member on the way, to assignment 3 where we were able to progress and build on our project idea even more. This experience overall was stressful but fun and, in the end, very worthwhile. We all had our strengths and weaknesses, and everyone was always happy to help if someone was struggling. No one would shy away from work as someone would always put their hand up to attempt various parts of the project.</p>
      <p>If we were to continue with more group assignments going forward, I would happily do it all over again with my team members at Team_Name_404.</p>

      <h2>Nour Zeroual</h2>
      <p>One of the primary things my group did well was working effectively together. Our meetings were extremely productive and every group member promptly completed their designated tasks. After being assigned the project we immediately began brainstorming topic ideas. As a result of our good collaboration we were able to find plenty of information. This process was successful due to the equal and active participation of each of my team members. In summary then, it can be acknowledged that our team communicated effectively, this clearly aided us in reaching our overall goals.</p>
      <p>If I could do something again differently, I would try to get everything done before the due date date. It could be said that effective time management seemed to hamper us. This was often due to conflicting schedules, workloads and other commitments</p>
      <p>This experience improved my communication skills and also taught me to take advantage of each group member's individual strengths when working as a team. A strategy that really helped me is asking my team about what was not clear to avoid any confusions as I found it incredibly beneficial to listen to other group members ideas and learn from them.</p>

      <h2>Key Group Takeaways from Assignment 3</h2>
         <p> As a group, we think Team_Name_404 worked very well together for Assignment 3 & 5. We were all able to participate regularly in the weekly or twice weekly meetings, taking turns to Chair and record Minutes/Actions. We all feel the work was divided well within the group across the whole assignment brief, and we each were able to learn new skills and develop our strengths in web design, wireframing, researching and writing. Each member was respectful and patient with others, and brought a lot of energy and great ideas for the concept development of Yogi. </p>

<p>The main hurdle we found in working towards completion of Assignment 3 and 5 was time management. We found that as a team we were still working on things right up until the due date, and it did create stress for team members in finishing our Assignment to the high standards we expected of ourselves. It was a lesson for us all in juggling study with our work/life commitments and COVID lockdowns, as well as making time for weekly unit participation and completing assignments in all of our other subjects. </p>

<p>The one thing that was most surprising for Team_Name_404 was again related to time management. How long things like layout, formatting, and report construction took was surprising. Coding was also very time consuming, in making the Assignment 3 website in GitHub, as well as wireframing for the Yogi prototype. This required members to also learn new skills, and perhaps the amount of work needed for Assignment 3 and 5 was underestimated. </p>

<p>Members of Team_Name_404 have learned to be very specific about which work is being done by which team member. We have also learned that more aggressive timelines for group completion of work is required going forward, as well as perhaps the need for appointing a team leader. Overall, Team_Name_404 has learned that working in groups can certainly have its funny moments, and how they can each fit into group dynamics. We have learned that we now have a fantastic project concept, that we have enjoyed developing together and we look forward to continuing as a group past the completion of Assignment 3 & 5 to bring Yogi to life! </p>
