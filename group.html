      <h2>Rebecca Watson</h2>
      <p>I have really enjoyed working with the members of Team_Name_404. We learnt a lot from our first assignment and were able to further develop a good group rapport, working together for the next two assignments. Each member was motivated to contribute, and the work was able to be distributed fairly within the group. There was a great level of respect in the group for each personâ€™s ideas and during discussion. </p>
<p>Personally, I prefer to not be doing too much assignment work on the due date. I prefer to be done a couple of days before, to reduce stress and have time to review the whole body of work, without the feeling of running out of time. This is probably the one thing I think could be improved. I understand that others have life commitments and are doing their best to also complete the work required, and may not be so anxious about deadlines as I am. </p>
<p>I was really surprised to see how the original project idea changed from assignment 2, during the assignment 3/5 process. I am personally really invested in being further involved in bringing the project to life as described in this assignment, past the mandatory work needed to deliver the assignments. I really believe in the project and actually working towards completing it - this is the thing that surprised me the most. I am excited to keep working with the team to build and deliver Yogi in the future. </p> 
<p>I learnt that as a Turbulent Architect (according to Myers-Briggs) it is in my nature to worry and stress over every little detail. I often take on too much work as a result, and I learned it is ok to let others take care of the work equally and trust they want to achieve as much as I do. I was not sure how working with people I have never met in real life would go, yet I have really enjoyed my time with the group members in assignment 3/5. It was great getting to know each member of Team_Name_404 on a more personal level, as fellow students also beginning their study journey with me.

      <p>One of the primary things my group did well was working effectively together. Our meetings were extremely productive and every group member promptly completed their designated tasks. After being assigned the project we immediately began brainstorming topic ideas. As a result of our good collaboration we were able to find plenty of information. This process was successful due to the equal and active participation of each of my team members. In summary then, it can be acknowledged that our team communicated effectively, this clearly aided us in reaching our overall goals.</p>
      <p>If I could do something again differently, I would try to get everything done before the due date date. It could be said that effective time management seemed to hamper us. This was often due to conflicting schedules, workloads and other commitments</p>
      <p>This experience improved my communication skills and also taught me to take advantage of each group member's individual strengths when working as a team. A strategy that really helped me is asking my team about what was not clear to avoid any confusions as I found it incredibly beneficial to listen to other group members ideas and learn from them.</p>
